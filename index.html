			<h2 class="subtitle">About me</h2>
			<p class="description">My name is Jiaqi and I am a M.Sc. in Engineering Physics from Polytechnique Montreal.
				 I am interested in mathematics, informatics and quantum information as well as history and cinema.
				 I also practice martial marts in my free time.</p>

			<h2 class="subtitle" >My hobbies</h2>
			<p class="description">
				Video games and martial arts hold a special place in my heart. I have been training Taekwon-do since the age of 14.
				Currently interested in Capoeira. I believe martial arts are a reflection of a culture. By learning, we can better understand each other.
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle">My research</h2>
			<p class="description">
				My masters' project is about optimization of pump spectral shape for quantum light generation. The code used for this project can be found on my GitHub page.
				Using the power of XLA from JAX, a machine learning module developped by Google, fast computation of iterative optimization schemes are made to minimize spectral entanglement
				between light generated by spontenous parametric down-conversion.
